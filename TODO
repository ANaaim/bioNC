Todo list for the development of the project bioNC

The template would be great to build generic biomechanical models based on experimental data.

InertiaParameters need to be generated in SCS or in NSCS ? it can be both...

model creation - on the way
- from experimental data ? (see the template)
- from biomod ?
- from opensim ?

add a methode to add joints to the model
add a class to add muscles to the model
add a class to add ligaments to the model
