Todo list for the development of the project bioNC

NaturalSegmentCoordinates would be better
same for NaturalSegmentCoordinateSystem

The template would be great to build generic biomechanical models based on experimental data.

segment.py need to be merge into one file

Does the natural axis and classic axis XYZ need to live together ?

InertiaParameters need to be generated in SCS or in NSCS ? it can be both...

model creat

verify some axis or not colinear for given alpha beta gamma in segment.

add a class to add kinematic constraints / joints between segments

add a class to add muscles

add a class to add ligaments

modify to_real() by update() it writes the model accordingly to the data.
