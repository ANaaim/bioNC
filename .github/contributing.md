# Contributing to 'bionc'
All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.
We recommend going through the list of [`issues`](https://github.com/ipuch/bioNC) to find issues that interest you, preferable those tagged with `good first issue`.
You can then get your development environment setup with the following instructions.

# Code Style [![Black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black) 
To maintain a consistent and readable codebase, we utilize the black code formatter. Before submitting your code, ensure it is formatted by running `black . -l120`. This command will format all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories to a maximum line length of 120 characters. If you haven't installed black, you can run `conda install -c conda-forge black`.
